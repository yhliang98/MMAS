# MMAS
Mouse motion analysis system for Morris water maze tests

MMAS consists of two parts: pose estimation and motion analysis. 
Before further processing, please make sure the frame rate of the videos are uniformed.

## Pose estimation
We trained our deep convolutional neural network on [Deeplabcut](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-018-0209-y). For more details of implentation, please [click here](https://github.com/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut). 

Our settings could be found in [config.yaml](MMAS/config.yaml)
The snapeshots of our model could be download from this [google drive link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/11-P8tfpumooU8yvgD4gXxcatPxpJPDif?usp=drive_link).
